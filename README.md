I have been interested in coding for over 12 years, ever since I started my undergraduate studies at Baruch College. I began with C++ for programming and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development. I've also dabbled in C# for web application development and Lua for mobile app development. I eventually transitioned to Python and React, which I continue to enjoy learning.
